### Converting formats like markdown to google documents
Unfortunately as of now, there isn't really an official solution that can
convert markdown to the very distinct format that google documents uses. I've
looked into pandoc and other solutions but none of them are usable in this
setup.

I have also tried hacking up a custom "compiler" but yet again, the speeds
alongside the complexity don't make much sense.  

### Moving documents to specific folders
- This is a TODO
